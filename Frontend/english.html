            <div>In year 2020, I had a great fascination to learn the German Language and start my career in Germany. To
                be well acquainted with the German language, I started searching German language classes and I found
                this class. I started from scratch, with 0 prior German knowledge. So when i started here, i felt that i
                could lag behind with no prior knowledge, but with the profound German knowledge, Immense Experience and
                Exquisite teaching skills of Esha mam, I never felt lagging behind. After finishing A1 level, I started
                developing more interest about the language, about german culture and i got the motive, to never stop
                learning this language. I ended up finishing B1 level here with not only boosting my german language
                skills, but also it evolved my personality with the great lessons that Mam taught. If big brand name
                doesn't matter to you and you really want to have a genuine teacher, with whom you can learn the
                language with tremendous motivation and too much fun, this is the class for you!!!<br><br>- Yash

            <div>I decided to re-learn German during my Engineering in 2019 after a gap of six years. As for any
                language, if you don’t use it for a while, you lose it. I was barely able to introduce myself in German
                when I first started coaching with Isha ma’am. With the level A1 examination date in sight, I remember
                being pretty stressed about being able to cope up with the syllabus and achieve key deliverables on the
                examination day. I believe this is what most learners struggle with and this is exactly where Isha ma’am
                shines. She, with her friendly, welcoming and encouraging personality makes sure that all her students
                become comfortable and loosen up towards a pretty complex language. Having doubts and asking questions
                is key to learning any language and she, as a coach always maintained a healthy atmosphere for the same.
                I’ve had a fair share of experience with a lot of teachers and I can personally vouch for her rare and
                almost unique quality of pacing herself differently for each student while making sure the core
                foundations for the language are built well. Her speaking and listening sessions prior to the exam
                surely kick out a ton of nervousness. She adjusted a lot for my academic commitments and pushed me when
                I slacked for no reason at all. This is what graduate students, irrespective of their domains will find
                very helpful. If you are genuinely interested in the German language, as a hobby or to get a
                certificate, you can find all the help you need right here.<br><br>- Hrishikesh Deshmukh<br>(Supply

            <div>Isha Doshi ma'am always provides a simple way/approach to learn complex things.During my tuition, ma'am
                made sure that all my basics are clear and assured that i get comfortable with the new language.All the
                skills- Speaking, Writing, Reading and Listening were given equal importance and time, and there was
                homework on regural basics fro practice as well which boosts our confidence. For certification of
                levels, enough practice is taken by ma'am to ensure that we succeed in the exam. "Learning German can be
                easy and fun" is what you will find here.<br><br>-Vedant Bhatambrekar<div>
